## Working Mode Wiring

### Working Mode

#### Working in relay control mode

use app "IO_ctrl", when button on bluetooh board pressed, app will receive relevant UUID data, when switch in app is pressed, UUID will send to EB08  

#### iBeacon mode

1.  Step 1: Configure the module as an iBeacon mode command
2.  Send via serial port: AT + HOSTEN3 Returns: OK
3.  Step 2: Let the module restart
4.  Send via serial port: AT + RST means reset
5.  Step 3: Change the UBID of iBeacon to (FDA50693A4E24FB1AFCFC6EB07647825)
6.  Send via serial port: AT + STRUUIDFDA50693A4E24FB1AFCFC6EB07647825 Back: OK
7.  Step 4: Change the Major value of iBeacon to (10)
8.  Send via serial port: AT + MAJOR000A returns OK
9.  Step 5: Change the minor value of iBeacon to (7)
10.  Send via serial port: AT + MINOR0007 Returns OK

* Also set manufactuer ID is necessary, because the factory set of UUID is the same:

1.  The factory ID is 65330 (decimal value) and the hexadecimal value is 1985
2.  Send via serial port: AT + VID1985 Returns: OK

#### PWM Cotrol

* The first step to set the PWM frequency is 250Hz (frequency range is 50 - 4KHZ)
* AT command: AT + PWMFRE250 returns OK
* The second step turns on the PWM
* AT command: AT + PWMOPEN1 return OK (1 is not open to open the PWM, 2 is turned on)
* The third step to open the set PWM pulse width (4-way PWM output, so you can set the 4-way PWM pulse width)
* AT command: AT + PWM1PUS90 return OK to set PWM1 pulse width is 90%
* AT command: AT + PWM2PUS10 return OK to set PWM2 pulse width is 10%
* The following are PWM3 and PWM4 settings, not one by one here about
* The fourth step user can read the working status of PWM
* AT command: AT + PWMPUS return to the state, see the manual
* Step 5 Turn off the PWM function
* AT command: AT + PWMOPEN0 This module will turn off the PWM function, and if the PWRC pin is high
* Level, the module will enter the low-power mode,

#### iBeacon Sensor

* Step 1: Configure the module to iBeacon mode
* Note that the sensor function is only applied in the iBeacon mode, so you need to configure the iBeacon mode
* Send via serial port: AT + HOSTEN3 Returns: OK
* Step 2: Let the module restart
* Send via serial port: AT + RST means reset
* Step 3: Set the temperature to 33 degrees
* Send via serial port: AT + TEMP33 Returns: OK
* Step 4: Set the humidity value to 11%
* Send via serial port: AT + HUMID11 returns OK
* Step 5: Set the power of the sensor to 90%
* Send via serial port: AT + BATT90 returns OK
* Since the sensor function is based on the iBeacon application, if your sensor is numerous, the above two sensor commands
* Can not meet your product applications, you can use iBeacon related instructions to transmit your sensor data
* AT + STRUUID + 32-bit string length, please note that this 32-bit data format: Hexadecimal string
* AT + MAJOR + 4-bit string length, the string format: hexadecimal string
* AT + MINOR + 4-bit string length, the string format: hexadecimal string

#### Power Consumption Setup

* The default broadcast interval is the smallest, due to different user's product requirements, the power consumption of products have great requirements, so our module also considered this, the module can broadcast interval is set by AT command
* The default broadcast interval is: AT + ADVIN0 is 100 ms
* Users need to have certain requirements for power consumption can be set by AT + ADVIN broadcast interval
* The AT command broadcasts the time current
* AT + ADVIN0 100ms 0.6mA
* AT + ADVIN1 500ms 0.1mA
* AT + ADVIN2 750ms 0.05mA
* AT + ADVIN3 1000ms 0.02mA
* The above is set by the AT command, the user can also set the broadcast interval through the phone, not the longer the better the broadcast interval, the broadcast interval is too long will affect the connection time, is to be a long time to connect with the phone, the general set 100 or 500ms About the same, the sensor application can be set up a little longer, because no connection
* Connection interval settings
* Users can connect with the phone when the current can be set, you can AT command or phone to set the AT command can be set by: AT + NEIN to set
* The AT command broadcasts the time current
* AT + NEIN0 10ms 0.8mA
* AT + NEIN1 100ms 0.2mA
* AT + NEIN2 500ms 0.05mA
* The above is through the AT command to set the connection interval, the user can also set the connection interval through the phone, not the connection interval set the longer the better, but also depends on the user to determine the use of the scene, the longer the interval does not adapt to penetration, If the general requirements for the default interval can be, if only some control applications, or small data should be, then the connection interval can be set a little longer.

#### Master to Slave, two bluetooth mode

* Master-slave Bluetooth module communication refers to two Bluetooth modules communicate with each other, one for the host, a slave, they communicate with each other, the first module for the slave module, the second module is the host module
* The first step will host and slave module power and the module serial port and USB serial or MCU serial port connection, pay attention to the need to cross the serial line, connect the AT command to start debugging
* The second step will be the first module from the machine to open the radio, the default is to open the broadcast from the machine, but also by sending AT + ADVEN1 to open the broadcast
* Step 3: Set the commands of the main module
* 1\) Set the module to host transparent mode, return OK to complete the set send command: AT + HOSTEN1 return OK
* 2\) Set the module to restart
* Send: AT + RST
* 3\) Scan the surrounding BLE command
* Send: T + SCAN1 Returns OK
* 4\) Read the number of BLE Bluetooth scanned (up to 8 slaves)
* AT + GETDCD returns DEV: 1 means scanning to a deviceÂ Â 
* 5\) Read the slave MAC address of the scan list (0-7)
* Send: AT + RSLV0 Returns: MAC: e3435480
* 6\) Connection scan list 0 device (0-7)
* Send: AT + CONNET0
* 7\) Send the command to find out whether it is connected with the slave
* Send: AT + GETSTAT Returns: STS: 11 Indicates that the connection has been madeÂ Â Â Â 
* 8\) The hardware judges whether it has been connected with the slave
* Module 6 pin for the connection status pin, the connection is successful for the low, not connected to high
* 9\) host and slave connection is successful, you can transparently transfer data

#### Master/slave pair/binding mode for data tranmissoin

* Sets the command for the master module
* 1\) Set the module to host transparent mode, return OK to complete the setup
* Send command: AT + HOSTEN1 returns OK
* 2\) Set the module to restart
* Send: AT + RST
* 3\) The host binds the slave MAC address
* Send the command: AT + BAND884AEA478140 to return OK
* 4\) The hardware judges whether it has been connected with the slave
* Module 6 pin for the connection status pin, the connection is successful for the low, not connected to high
* 5\) After the host and the slave connection is successful, you can pass through the data, and binding only once, the next power does not need to
* Time binding, later used as long as the binding of the slave in the host communication range, the host will automatically connect with the slave, the connection, they can be transparent between the data.
* 6\) Unbind the slave
* Send: AT + CLRBAND Returns OK
* As a result of the binding from the machine, the host will have been connected with the binding from the machine, even if the machine is closed, the host will search around to see if there is bound from the machine, if there is to connect with it, After the host will no longer be bound with the slave to connect,
* Note: When the above host binds the MAC address of the slave, you need to know the MAC address of the slave. The MAC address of the slave can be read by AT + MAC.

#### Sensor read function

* Connect the serial port (RXD, TXD) of the USB serial or MCU to the module, and connect the PWRC pin of the module to the power supply (VCC, GND) of the module when sending commands using the serial port. , The supply voltage is 3.3V or 3V
* According to the above connection line, began to talk about the AT command operation
* Step 1: Configure the module as a host observer
* Send via serial port: AT + HOSTEN2 Returns: OK
* Step 2: Let the module restart
* Send via serial port: AT + RST means reset
* Through the above settings, the module has been configured for the host observer mode, then start the host machine to receive the data from the sensor, the host serial port to receive the sensor data format is as follows
* (+) Byte (byte) VID + 1 (byte) TEMP + 1 (byte) DATA format: 2 (bytes) Head + 6 (bytes) MAC + 1 (byte) RSSI + + 1 (bytes) BATT
* The user can identify their own sensor data through the VID, and then distinguish each sensor by MAC address
* Note: the data received by the host MAJOR, MINOR, VID, TEMP, HUMID, BATT corresponds to the slave transmission
* The data sent by the AT command in the sensor mode
* AT + MAJOR000A
* AT + MINOR0007
* AT + VID6677
* AT + TEMP44
* AT + TEMP44
* AT + BATT90

#### Replace your module by UUID

* For example, before you use the transparent module UUID service for the 0XFFF0, features UUID 0XFFF1,
* You only need to send these two commands to change the service UUID and feature UUID of our module.
* Send via serial port:
* AT + SVRUUIDFFF0 Returns: OK
* AT + CHRUUIDFFF1 Returns: OK
